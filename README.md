# MARTA_which-bus
This is a script that tells which buses will take you to your desired MARTA bus stop from the given train station and what time the buses leave.

## Purpose
This project aims to save significant amounts of time by giving the user very concise information rather than the user having to check each bus schedule to see which will arrive at the most convenient location.

### Input
The script takes in the MARTA station that the user will be leaving from as well as the bus stop the user desires to go to.

### Output
The script outputs a DataFrame with timings for all buses that go to the desired destination. The DataFrame will only show a few timings for each bus, starting from about the time the script is run. Additionally, the DataFrame will be ordered with arrival time in ascending order.
